### <div style={{color:"red"}}>Background</div>
- Who am I
- How did I end up at Pipe
- Expectations / worries

In September last year (2020) I started working remotely at Pipe, a US-based
startup that's creating a new asset class and helping startups grow "without
debt and dilution". During the holidays I spent some time reflecting on how my
first 3 months have been and decided to do a writeup on how/why I ended up at
Pipe, how it's been, and what I've learned thus far. Hopefully you find
something that's applicable to your work!

In the spring of 2020 I graduated from Aalto University in Helsinki and after
spending the last ~6 months writing performant c++ for visual positioning
(thing ARKit, but better :)) I was faced with the decision that most people
have to face at some point -- what do I want to do with my life. As you've
probably already figured out, I ended up at Pipe -- but why Pipe?

### Back at a Startup
I started my career at a 4 person startup in Helsinki but since then each
consecutive company I've worked at has been larger than the last (ending up
with a stint at BCG with 21k employees). However, I realized that I kind of
miss the impact you can have at a smaller company.  Fintech is also something
that, ever since my internship at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), I've been
really interested in.

With all this said you can see how it felt like a perfect
fit when [@Peter](https://twitter.com/peterldowns) reached out to me about
Pipe. However, there was a catch - the Pipe team is spread around the US (one
non-engineer in Germany) while I'm in Helsinki Finland (and was planning to
stay here for the near future at least).

I felt pretty confident in that remote work itself is effective when done
right, for example, some of the best engineers I worked with at Stripe were
remote. During the spring (of 2020) it had also become clear that even
companies less  set up for remote work had been able to turn around and make it
work. At BCG we wondered whether the client we worked with would be able to get
anything done (large, slow, industrial goods) - but even they managed to turn
on a dime and be somewhat effective. The question for me was the timezone --
can remote work still be effective even if your working hours only overlap for
a couple of hours? The next section will be about how we've handled these
challenges at Pipe, and how it can even be an advantage in some situations.

<div style={{display: "none"}}>
During the past year (for any future readers: 2020) almost everyone in tech has
had to familiarize themselves with remote work. I felt pretty confident in that
remote work itself is effective when done right - the best engineers I worked with at
Stripe were remote (and I'd even worked remotely at BCG for a brief period of
time).

### <div style={{color:"red"}}>Remote work</div>
- Worked well, here are some key takeaways / best practices that worked for us / me
- Why it works at Pipe:
    - Small team
    - Good infra
    - Team aligned, meeting awerse, supportive, ...

### Asynchronous communication

Best practice for a lot of engineering anyways. Forced to do it.

### Personal connections

Small team. Possible to have one-on-ones with everyone. Go for a walk.
Hopefully offsite... :(

### Support, team aligned

Peter makes sure we maintain standards. Strongly underline that decisions for
the future etc. won't be decided when everyone's not present.

### Good infra

Less effective at work if I'm afraid of deploying, waiting for reviews etc.

Stable codebase, good infra. Can merge trivial changes.

*For me the biggest unknown was the time zone difference, here's what I did,
what Pipe did, to make it work.*


### Challenges 

- Personal connection
- responsibility

### <div style={{color:"red"}}>Conclusion</div>
- Summary
- Recommendation: give it a try. However:
    - Requires a company that's supportive
    - Smaller team = better, intimate even though remote
    - Ability to take initiative. Normal remote working, noone will tell you
      what to do all the time. Remote work in different time-zone: noone will
      even be awake to tell you what to o

Hi I'm Johan. I like working with smart people and solving hard problems.

I'm currently working at [Pipe](https://pipe.com), helping Saas companies
grow dilution-free.

Previously, I've worked at (in chronological order):
[Smartly.io](https://www.smartly.io),
[Stripe](https://stripe.com),
[Palantir](https://www.palantir.com) and
[BCG](https://www.bcg.com/).

I studied computer science at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en).

I wrote my Master's thesis on [Localization and Mapping for Visual-Inertial
Odometry](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/44983?locale-attribute=en).
The C++ implementation of the thesis is used by [Spectacular
AI](https://www.spectacularai.com/).

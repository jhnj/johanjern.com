Hi I'm Johan. I like working with smart people and solving hard problems.

I'm currently building something new (with [Miika](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miikahuttunen/)
and [Mikko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikko-m%C3%A4ntyl%C3%A4-29b3779a/)).

Previously, I've worked at (in reverse chronological order):
[Pipe](https://pipe.com),
[BCG](https://www.bcg.com/),
[Palantir](https://www.palantir.com),
[Stripe](https://stripe.com) and
[Smartly.io](https://www.smartly.io).

I studied computer science at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en).

I wrote my Master's thesis on [Localization and Mapping for Visual-Inertial
Odometry](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/44983?locale-attribute=en).
The C++ implementation of the thesis is used by [Spectacular
AI](https://www.spectacularai.com/).
